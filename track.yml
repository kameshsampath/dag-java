title: Java GitOps
teaser: How to get started with GitOps with Drone,Argo and Gitea
description: |-
  **TODO**: Description will be updated, its just a placeholder
  A demo to demonstrate on how to setup [Drone](https://drone.io), [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) and [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) as your local Kubernetes Cluster.

  This demo also shows how to use the Argo CD [declarative setup](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/) to setup [Drone](https://drone.io) with Drone Kubernetes runner.

  The stack also deploys [Argo CD Image Updater](https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to enable updating the application images via GitOps.
